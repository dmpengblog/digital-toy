# Tubescope_Supply.png

A fully featured TL494 based forward converter, designed for powering a tube oscilloscope (hence the 6.3V 10A filament winding and 250V output). A blocking oscillator provides startup current, isolated CRT filament power and high voltage. Unfortunately, the blocking oscillator is open loop, so it will dissipate excessive power at high line voltage.
# Tubescope_Vertical.png

Tube oscilloscope vertical attenuator, preamp and deflection stages. Should provide approximately 5MHz bandwidth, not bad for using no distributed amplifiers, and only about 1/4 the bandwidth of a comparable solid state circuit.
# Tube_Guitar_Preamp.png

A modification of my old preamp circuit, incorporating a guitar tone stack circuit.
# Tube_Guitar_Preamp_2.png

A modification of my old preamp circuit, incorporating a guitar tone stack circuit and "dirty/clean" switch.
# Tube_Half_Bridge.png

A possible realization of tubes in half bridge. In particular, note the screen resistors Rs, required to prevent the screens from going Chernobyl when driving inductive loads (where plate voltage will be negative for a portion of the cycle).
# Tube_HV_Supply.png

A small tube amplifier power supply, suitable for automotive operation. Capacity about 10W.
