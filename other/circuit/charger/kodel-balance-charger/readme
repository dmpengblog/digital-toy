================================================================================
The balancers from Suzanne are fine, my design only differs on these points:

pro (for use as part of a charger):
- non-SMD components for easier soldering
- 6 watt resistors to do high-current charging
- cheaper comparator/reference voltage then the MAX component (total BOM is only a few euro's)

cons:
- due to (a little bit tooo) cheap comparator, no output driver so fet's might get a little warm. Nothing dramatic, but I decided to but a cooling fin on anyways
- more work since no PCB is available so you have to solder it on a breadboard. (the whole last design steps / breadboarding / testing part took me about 4 hours)

Here's the schematic.
The parts are identified on top.
The second comparator drawn in red is used to alert the user of cell undervoltage, so nobody would try to recharge a pack depleted below 3 volts.
The resistor R4 is accidentaly crossed out but is an essential part of the diagram.
I tried a few different values for the capacitors (basically cause I didn't have 3 identical ones laying around in the order from 10-500nF. They all work great, however when the cells start to become full, they blink/flicker at different speeds. I guess the higher the blinking speed, the more even the charge current is on the cell, so I'll go with 10nF on all 3 of them.

Oh yess, the drawing only illustrates 1 "lipo balancer". You need to make 3 of these for a 3s charger and add a LM350 as current limiter to the entrance of the circuit.

Pulsing is not required. I was just suggesting an alternative to the circuit that had already been posted, which does pulse. Yes, the capacitor makes certain that the TL431 does not operate in linear mode, so it pulses. Pulsing makes sure that the power dissipation is in the resistor, not the transistor, and in this case it simplifies the LED circuit. In the linear balancers that I've posted here in the past, there had to be a separate transistor for the LED. Almost all commercial balancers pulse, but that's mostly because they use microcontrollers instead of linear devices. The rate of the pulsing gives you an idea of how far out of balance the pack is.
