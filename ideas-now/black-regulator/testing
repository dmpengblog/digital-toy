====================


(4.68×0.232)÷(12.61×(0.105−0.005))  = 86%  stop cap 470pf speed cap on regulator C to switch B 

(4.68×0.232)÷(12.61×(0.105−0.005))  =86%   stop cap 1.5nf, and speed cap on regulator C to switch B 

====================
(4.90×0.72)÷(0.34×12.07)   = 85%    
1. switch transistor : tip127    
2.R1 change to 4k    (very key change, otherwise ouput keep at 4.3V instead of at 5V)
3.add speed cap (from 10mA to 700mA works well)

============ R1 500R ==============
(0.3×4.8)÷(12.22×0.14) =  82%
R1 may not very critical for circuit starting...????
