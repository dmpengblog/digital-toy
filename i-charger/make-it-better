========================================
i-charger-51
1.the line width is thin in almost all signal
2.does not consideration the heat sink footprint for PMOSFET: about 1.5W..., >100oC in 1.2A/6.5V
3.the 3W resistor footprint is smaller than the component, it's a error
4.the 1117 packages is wrong that's the 7805's package!!!
5.CPU  51 should pull down not up. 
6. 51 pin not pull up in some nets.

get so many experience
